| hmcts/base/node/stretch-slim-lts-10:latest | Debian stretch and nodeJS LTS 10 version       |

## Reasoning

These images are based on nodeJS official ones, with the addition of a specific `hmcts` user, used for consistent runtime parameters.

These images are ought to be used for application runtimes, nothing prevents the use of other intermediate images to build your projects.
